# Task Nine - HTML and Python Registration Form

## Project Overview

This project includes two main tasks:

1. **HTML Registration Form**: A user-friendly form for collecting registration details such as full name, email, password, gender, and date of birth.
2. **Python Script**: A Python script that processes user input directly through the terminal. It validates input data using regular expressions for email validation and ensures that passwords match before completing the registration process.

## Contents

- **`index.html`**: An HTML registration form styled with CSS.
- **`app.py`**: A Python script that processes user input from the terminal, validates the input, and displays a success message upon successful registration.
- **`styles.css`**: A CSS file used to style the HTML registration form.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
